v0.0.10 (May 19, 2016)
----------------------

Command line interface
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- The full command-line argument namespace is now saved out with the other
  experiment parameters for better reproducibility.

Registration workflow
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- The correct registration matrix to go from the epi space to the anatomy is
  now written out during the registration so that downstream results from
  experiments that use the ``-regexp`` flag are correct.
